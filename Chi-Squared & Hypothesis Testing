a) The variables we are interested in are "Room Type" and "Borough".
b) Null Hypothesis: The room type offered is independent of the borough the listing is offered in.
Alternate Hypothesis: The room type offered is dependent on the borough the listing is offered in.

```{r}
listings <- read.csv("/Users/elifyildirim/Desktop/Statistics II/listings.csv")

#colnames(listings)
#listings$neighbourhood
#listings$neighbourhood_group

airbnb <- table(listings$neighbourhood_group, listings$room_type)
airbnb


airbnb_row <- rowSums(airbnb)
airbnb_cols <- colSums(airbnb)
airbnb_total <- sum(airbnb)

#Manual expected values

#Shared rooms in Queens
EV_1 <- (airbnb_row["Queens"] * airbnb_cols["Shared room"]) / airbnb_total

#Entire home/apt in Manhattan
EV_2 <-  (airbnb_row["Manhattan"] * airbnb_cols["Entire home/apt"]) / airbnb_total


```


```{r}
#d) Using my function

airbnb_2 <- my.chisq.test(airbnb)
print(airbnb_2)
```
```{r}
#d) Using R's prebuilt function
chisq.test(airbnb)
```
Using my function for chi-squared, along with R's prebuilt function, I obtained a chi-squared statistic of 1609.4. This is a huge number, which means there is a large significant difference between the expected values of the cells and the actual values in the cells. Additionally, we obtained an extremely small p-value which is basically zero. This means that the odds of differences this dramatic occuring simply by chance is virtually none. The large chi-squared, paired with a p-value of virtually zero, are both strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

a)
Null hypothesis: Happiness is independent of gender
Alternate hypothesis: Happiness is dependent on gender

b)
A small chi-squared value like 1.04 means that there is a small difference between the expected cell counts and the observed cell counts. A larger chi-squared value would imply that there is infact a relationship between happiness and gender. A p-value of 0.59 is greater than 0.05, meaning we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Both of these suggest that there is no observanle relationship between happiness and gender.

Null hypothesis: Primary food choice is independent of which lake the alligators are in
Alternative hypothesis: Primary food choice is dependent on which lake the alligators are in


c)
df = (2−1)×(4−1) = 3
```{r}
qchisq(0.95, df = 3)
qchisq(0.99, df = 3)
```
At both a 95% and 99% significance level, a chi squared statistic of 16.79 is a good amount over the corresponding critical values. For a 95% significance level, we expected ~7.81, and for a 99% significance level, we expected ~11.34. Our value of 16.79 is above these thresholds, meaning that the differences in food source are statistically significant.

d) A p-value of < 0.001 indicates that there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In context, this means that there is a less than 0.1% chance that the observed differences in the different primary food choices across the two lakes was due to chance.
